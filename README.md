### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Paulo Henrique, a Front-end Developer with a degree in Systems Analysis and Development. 
My current primary focus is on front-end development, but I'm also keen to expand my knowledge in back-end development and UI design.

So I decided to focus on building my career as a software developer and so far my main skills include:

![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-05122A?.svg?style=flate&logo=typescript&logoColor=0248b8)
![Next JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/NextJS-05122A?style=flate&logo=next.js&logoColor=0d0d0d)  


Besides this I have learned how to have the discipline not to give up when things get complicated (and I have learned how to test my own code). Certainly I still have a lot more to learn, a lot more problems to solve, a lot more to develop and this is what makes me love coding.
