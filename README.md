### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Paulo Henrique, a Full Stack Developer with a degree in Systems Analysis and Development. 
My current primary focus is on front-end and back-end development, but I'm also eager to learn more about UI design.

So I decided to focus on building my career as a software developer and so far my main skills include:

![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-05122A?.svg?style=flate&logo=typescript&logoColor=0248b8)
![Next JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/NextJS-05122A?style=flate&logo=next.js&logoColor=0d0d0d)

Besides this I have learned how to have the discipline not to give up when things get complicated. Certainly I still have a lot more to learn, a lot more problems to solve, a lot more to develop and this is what makes me love coding.

ðŸ’¬ Come ask me about anything, it would be my pleasure to speak with you!
